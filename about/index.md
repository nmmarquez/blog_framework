Researcher of demographic methods, spatial-temporal models, and the Chicano experience. I started getting interested in demography and population studies while working for the Laboratory of Comparative Ethology at the [National Institute of Child Health and Development](https://www.nichd.nih.gov/) doing data collection for a logitudinal study concerning the effects of early life trauma on adolescent and adult health. I was then a fellow at the [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation](http://www.healthdata.org/) in Seattle working on the  Global Burden of Disease Project as an algorithm and statistical methods developer. I have also had the opportunity to work alongside some great people at [Instituto Nacional de Salud PÃºblica](https://www.insp.mx/) contributing to small area estimates for child mortality across Mexico. This led to the development my Masters In Public Health thesis at the University of Washington.

I am currently completing my PhD in Sociology at the [University of Washington](https://soc.washington.edu/people/neal-marquez) where I am continuing to work on small area estimates of demographic indicators. I am also exploring using non-traditional data sources, such as social media and other digital data, to estimate migratory stocks and flows alongside researchers at the [Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/).
